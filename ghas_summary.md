# GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) Summary

## What is code scanning?
Code scanning automatically checks your code for security vulnerabilities and coding errors. It uses tools like CodeQL to scan code as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

## What is secret scanning?
Secret scanning detects hardcoded secrets like API keys and passwords in your GitHub repository and alerts you before they’re exposed.

## What is dependency review?
Dependency review shows what dependencies are added, removed, or changed in a pull request—and warns you if any of them have known vulnerabilities.

## Why is shift-left security important?
Shift-left security means identifying and fixing security issues early in the development cycle—during coding, not after deployment. It’s faster, cheaper, and safer.
